User Input-

For taking USer Input in Java we use Scanner Class.

import java.util.Scanner;
public class UserInput {
    public static void main(String [] args) {
      Scanner theValue = new Scanner(System.in);
      int num = theValue.nextInt() ---> For Integer.
      num = theValue.nextLine() ---> String.
      num = theValue.charAt() ---> Character.
    }
}

Differnece While & Do While -
1) If Condition is True than only while loop is executed.
if condition is false While loop does'nt execute.

2) Do while loop execute once if condition is false.

3) O/p of while and Do while is same after 1st execution of
program.


Operator(&&,||) -

1) IN && if both the condition is true
than (&&) evalutes to true. If one condition
is false (&&) its evalutes to false.
In (&&) if first condition is false 2nd 
does'nt evaluates.


2) IN || if one of the condition is true
than (||) evalutes to true. 
In (||) if first condition is True 2nd 
does'nt evaluates.
